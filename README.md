# one-click-workout
React app for tracking progress through a workout challenge with single button interactions.

The workout is specified in data.json, and progress is tracked using the browser's local storage. Intended for use with a Chromecast device, but should work elsewhere too.

The example workout is scraped from [Chloe Ting's Summer Shred Challenge 2021](https://www.chloeting.com/program/2021/summer-shred-challenge.html) using websiteparser.py.
